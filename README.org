The above will submit the job to ~sbatch~ automatically write the
script to ~scripts/~ and automatically write logs/{name}.err and
logs/{name}.out. It will have today's date in the log and script
names.

The script to run() can also contain ~$variables~ which are filled
with the cmd_kwarg dict.  E.g. ~echo $name~ could be filled with
~cmd_kwargs={'name': 'sally'}~

A command can be tested (not sent to queue) by setting the ~_cmd~ are
